        Adding custom HTML to your app impacts safety, styling, and
        maintainability. We sanitize HTML with `DOMPurify
        <https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify>`_, but inserting HTML remains a
        developer risk. Passing untrusted code to ``st.html`` or dynamically
        loading external code can increase the risk of vulnerabilities in your
        app.

        ``st.html`` content is **not** iframed. Executing JavaScript is not
        supported at this time.

        Parameters
        ----------
        body : str, Path, Any
            The HTML code to insert, or path to an HTML code file which is
            loaded and inserted.

            If the provided string is the path of a local file, Streamlit will
            load the file and render its contents as HTML. Otherwise, Streamlit
            will render the string directly as HTML.

            If this argument is an object with a `_repr_html_` method, this
            will call `_repr_html_` and render the output.

        Example
        -------
        >>> import streamlit as st
        >>>
        >>> st.html(
        ...     "<p><span style='text-decoration: line-through double red;'>Oops</span>!</p>"
        ... )
